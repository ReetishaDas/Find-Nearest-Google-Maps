# Find Nearest Places
A Flutter Application utilizing Google Maps and Geolocator.

## Getting Started

I created a Google project, enabled the Android SDK, IOS SDK, and Places API in my Google Cloud Console and enabled billing for google maps services in the project.

Obtain an API key and replace the FILL_YOUR_API_KEY placeholders in 
- ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift
- android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
- lib/services/places_service.dart
